# Heart-Disease-Identification-Method-using-Machine-Learning
Heart disease, alternatively known as cardiovascular disease, encases various conditions that impact the heart and is the primary basis of death worldwide over the span of the past few decades. Machine Learning is used across many ranges around the world. The healthcare industry is no exclusion. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of locomotors disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important intuitions to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and dealing per patient basis. We work on predicting possible Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning.
